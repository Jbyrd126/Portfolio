          Johnny Ryall is the bum on my stoop I gave him fifty cents to buy
          some soup He knows the time with the fresh Gucci watch He's even
          more over than the mayor Ed Koch Washing windows on the Bowery at a
          quarter to four 'Cause he ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
          Living on borrowed time and borrowed money Sleepin' on the street
          there ain't a damn thing funny Hand me down food and hand me down
          clothes A rockabilly past of which nobody knows Makes his home all
          over the place He goes to sleep by falling down on his face
          Sometimes known as the leader of the homeless Sometimes drunk and
          he's always phoneless Sleepin' on the street in a cardboard box He's
          better off drinkin' than smokin' the rocks Johnny Ryall, Johnny
          Ryall He drinks where he lies He's covered with flies He's got the
          hand me down Pumas and the tie dyes Go upstate and get your head
          together Thunderbird is the word and you're light as a feather Detox
          at the flop house no booze allowed Remember the good old days with
          the rockabilly crowd Memphis is where he's from He lives in the
          street but he's no bum A rockabilly star from the days of old He
          used to have teeth all filled with gold A platinum voice but only
          gold records On the bass was boots on the drums was checkers Luis
          Vuitton with the Gucci guitar Johnny Ryall Who do you think you are
          Johnny Ryall, Johnny Ryall Donald Trump Donald Tramp living in the
          Men's Shelter Wonder Bread bag shoes and singing Helter Skelter He
          asks for a dollar you know what it's for Bottle after bottle he'll
          always need more He's no less important than you working class
          stiffs Drinks a lot of liquor but he don't drink piss Paid his dues
          playing the blues He claims that he wrote the Blue Suede Shoes Elvis
          shaved his head when he went into the army That's right y'all his
          name is Johnny Johnny Ryall, Johnny Ryall
